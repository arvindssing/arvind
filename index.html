<summary><b>An Elementary School Classroom in a Slum</b></summary>
<p style="background: yellow;">Children's faces are very far from energy and hope.There is no hope on their faces.They just like unwanted grass which grows anywhere and everywhere.It seems the world doesn't need them.They suffer malnutrition and hunger.The poet describes the bad condition of the classroom.The walls are so dirty that they looked and smelled like a sour cream.There are some pictures and paintings on the walls,including church building,picture of tyrolese vally with different flowers and a large map of the world but children have no idea about them which is shown in the classroom.Their future is full of uncertainty and darkness.They have no hope of getting out this foggy and dirty slum.There is no open space where they can see clearly the open sky.They only can dream of this world,not see or feel it.These windowes look like catacombs.All kinds of social injustice and class inequalities should be abolished so that the poor can alsoget a fair chance to live.</p>
